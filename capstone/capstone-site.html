	<p id="parti2">"Are you voting with your sister's ID?"</p>
<p>On November 8th, 2016, Finley Wolff, a then-35-year-old man, approached the polls of Lafayette, Indiana, to vote for a new President.</p>

<button onClick="JavaScript:exampleFunction()">Universal Truths</button>
<img class="logo" src="img/zombie-boy-test.svg">

<p>Unlike thousands of other residents, though, Wolff was stopped when the poll workers saw his driver’s license.</p>

<p>“Are you voting with your sister’s ID?” Wolff remembers one official asking. “What’s going on here?”</p>

<p>Wolff, in fact, was not voting with his sister’s ID. In 2016, Wolff was a transgender man in the middle of his transition. While he had begun medical treatment at the time, he hadn’t yet changed the name, photo, and gender marker on his ID, which meant that he no longer resembled the picture on his driver’s license when he went to the polls. For Wolff, however, the election was important enough to try and make his vote count—despite having to argue with poll workers about the validity of his ID.</p>

<p>Indiana is one of eight states across the U.S. with strict photo ID requirements for its voters, which it officially passed into law in 2008 (which set a precedent that other states quickly followed). To vote in Indiana, eligible residents must present an ID that meets four criteria: it must display the resident’s photo; a name that conforms to the name on the voter registration record; an expiration date (and is either currently active or expired after the previous election); and must been issued by the federal government or by the state of Indiana.</p>

<p>For transgender people who have begun medically transitioning, however, this can complicate things very quickly. Many trans folks who have begun to transition often end up looking very different from their pre-transition selves, sometimes to the point of being unrecognizable, as in Wolff’s case in Indiana. In addition to the changes in appearance, a trans person voting with a name or gender marker that does not seem to match their gender presentation can rouse suspicion about voter fraud—potentially forcing someone to out themself as trans in order to explain the discrepancies on their ID and be able to vote, and possibly resulting in some being turned away from the polls entirely.</p>

<p>This difficult situation has not changed from 2016; in fact, a Williams Institute study from February 2020, estimated that over 378,000 voter-eligible trans people—or 42.4% of all voter-eligible trans people—might face barriers in the November 2020 election to voting due to voter registration requirements and voter ID laws. The study also estimated that around one-fifth of those at risk would reside in the eight strict photo ID states, where an acceptable ID must fall into very narrow parameters, and can rouse suspicion when it does not.</p>

<p>Wolff’s story had a relatively good ending; after spending several minutes arguing with the poll workers about his driver’s license, he was allowed into the booths, and has since legally changed his name and gender marker. However, Wolff’s experience voting while trans points to a larger issue: that lacking an accurate government-issued ID can keep transgender people from accessing things like housing, employment—and the right to vote.</p>

<p id="partii">Part II</p>
<p id="partii2">A $25,000 ID</p>

<p>Government-issued IDs today can often be lifelines. In the United States, having some form of ID is what allows people to rent or own a home, find a job, and even drive. And in all but 14 states, some form of government-issued ID is required in order to either vote or register to vote.</p>

<p>For how essential they are to modern life (and voting), however, IDs are not always easy to access.</p>

<p>Jeff Graham, the executive director of Georgia Equality, an organization aimed at increasing LGBTQ+ equality in Georgia, another strict photo voter ID state, agrees, saying that the current voter ID laws can include a disproportionate impact on rural communities, the elderly, low-income folks, as well as the transgender community—the latter due to Georgia’s restrictive laws around gender marker changes.</p>

<p>In Georgia, the laws are not only restrictive (and becoming more so) but also expensive. In order to change one’s gender marker on a driver’s license there, a person must submit evidence (either a court order or a physician’s letter) of gender affirmation surgery. Without a surgery—that, according to the Philadelphia Center for Transgender Surgery, can run up to $25,000—no gender marker change is possible. And Georgia isn’t alone; according to the Movement Advancement Project (MAP), eight states require surgery in order for someone to get their gender marker changed on their driver’s license. (Along with Georgia, Tennessee also falls into both categories of having strict photo ID requirements while requiring surgery for a change on ID.)</p>

<p id="tableparagraph">Even in states without such restrictive laws, however, the process isn’t always easy. Some have a process that is easy to understand and do not require a doctor’s letter; others have a more difficult process and a limited number of medical providers from whom they will accept a letter. Some states have no process set in stone for people changing their gender marker, and some have no clear policy at all. And even when states do have non-burdensome policies around gender marker changes, human error (or judgement) can come into play.
<br>
<br>
Mathiae Rowe, a 20-year-old nonbinary college student in Duffield, Virginia, saw this happen when some of his friends decided to change their gender markers. In order to change one’s gender marker in Virginia, one only has to request a new license and fill out a form. The state also recently added the X gender marker as an option, which, for some nonbinary people, can represent their gender more accurately than an M or F marker, and which Rowe’s friends wanted to get. But when they decided to go and change their gender markers, they did not get what they had asked for.
<br>
<br>
“They actually had to go back to the DMV and fix it, because the person that selected their gender markers selected it as female, instead of the [X] selection that they [requested],” said Rowe.
<br>
<br>
Gender markers (and the confusing, highly variable laws surrounding them) are one of many areas in which protections for trans people in the U.S. are notoriously patchy. Because gender is not a federally protected class, any protections based on gender are up to the states to determine. (The one exception is employment discrimination: in June of 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that Title VII extends to protect people on the basis of sexuality and gender identity in the workplace and while looking for work.) However, 21 states in the U.S. do not prohibit housing discrimination on those bases; 23 do not prohibit discrimination in public accommodations such as restaurants or hotels); and 35 do not prohibit discrimination in credit lending. And while there is a bill currently moving through Congress called the Equality Act that hopes to change this by classifying gender and sexuality as federally protected classes, at the moment, protections are still divergent, at best.
<br>
<br>
The effects of these variable protections are clear: while transgender adults make up about 0.4% of the U.S. population, a recent study found that 8% had experienced homelessness sometime within the last year. Another study from 2019 found that 63% of binary transgender adults and 80% of gender-non-conforming adults were experiencing unsheltered homelessness, as compared to 49% of their cisgender peers.
<br>
<br>
Despite increasing visibility and (over time) growing rates of acceptance, trans people are still left vulnerable to prejudice when legal protections are nonexistent—or when the legal protections that they need, like accurate IDs, are difficult to come by.</p></section>

<p id="partiii">Part III</p>
<p id="partiii2">Dog Tags and Discharge Papers</p>

<p>For how important government-issued IDs are, however, they are a relatively new invention.</p>

<p>Identification issued by the government was not at all common until World War I, says Professor Claire Potter, a professor of history at the New School for Social Research.</p>

<p>“Most people didn’t have birth certificates, in the 19th century,” said Potter. “You didn’t need identification for anything, you know - and how you identified yourself often was through letters of introduction, if you were upper-class.”</p>

<p>“But after World War I, there’s this sort of new nationalism,” Potter continued. “And so then, of course, the United States, um, closes down immigration, restricts immigration by 1926, right? So they’re really trying to restrict mobility. And, um, so that’s the point at which people need to have a passport.”</p>

<p>The rise of government-issued identification continued throughout the first half of the 20th century: after WWI came Social Security numbers and cards with the Social Security Act of 1935. Some states began issuing drivers’ licenses sporadically throughout the first half of the 20th century, and all states were officially issuing them by 1954.</p>

<p>World War II saw the rise of another new type of ID: dog tags and discharge papers. While dog tags identified a soldier killed in battle, discharge papers were a type of ID that former soldiers could use to reap benefits that the GI Bill of 1944 conferred: education, guarantee of home ownership loans, and unemployment benefits. However, the bill came with a requirement: in order to be eligible for the benefits conferred, one had to have been honorably discharged. In the Army and the Army Air Force, “blue discharges” (charges that were technically neither honorable nor dishonorable, but often carried the same stigma as dishonorable discharges) were disproportionately given out to Black and queer military members during WWII—and while they were abolished in 1947, it rendered over 48,000 soldiers ineligible to claim the benefits of the GI Bill.</p>

<p>Government-issued IDs discrediting or complicating people’s lives—usually marginalized people—has not abated over the last 70-odd years, either. To get an ID at all, Professor Potter pointed out, you needed to have some papers indicating your identity; if, say, someone is homeless and has no identifying papers, how are they supposed to get an ID? (And of course, if they don’t have an ID, how are they supposed to rent or buy a home?)</p>

<p>The financial cost can also be considerable: drivers' licenses can cost up to $89, in addition to other fees, and baseline state ID cards can range from $1-2 to $64, both depending on the state. (This is to say nothing of passport fees, where a new passport book for an adult can cost up to $145.)</p>

<p>The financial cost, though, is only one of the unseen penalties imposed by voter ID laws. Despite the necessity of government-issued IDs, without papers, or money, or even the ability to go to a DMV, they can be difficult or impossible to access. For trans people, who may have to jump through a series of hoops to get an ID that accurately reflects their gender, in addition to having the necessary documents for getting an ID at all, it becomes doubly difficult—so much so that over 378,000 voter-eligible trans people might have faced barriers to voting in November 2020 as a direct result of voter ID and registration laws. And with the aforementioned patchwork spread of trans protections throughout the US, social and economic disenfranchisement also follow voter disenfranchisement.</p>

<p id="partiv">Part IV</p>
<p id="partiv2">"[It] was worth it to me."</p>

<p>Some, however, also see reasons for hope.</p>

<p>One primary reason is the Equality Act, which is currently being debated by the Senate. If passed, it would provide protection in employment discrimination, strengthening the current Title VII protections—but would also protect LGBTQ+ Americans from housing, education, credit, and public accommodations discrimination. Legally speaking, the Equality Act passing into law would effectively open doors to some of the first explicit trans rights legislation.</p>

<p>Professor Potter believes the bill would make “a huge difference” for trans people, if passed: right now, they said, if someone is discriminated against for being trans in New York, they can file charges against the discriminatory person or organization. If they’re discriminated against in Lawrence, Kansas? Not so much.</p>

<p>But there are some justified skeptics, too. Finn Meyerhoffer, a 21-year-old trans man from Appomattox, VA., isn’t sure how much would actually change in his day-to-day life with the passage of the act. “I can hope, but my experience is that people are stubborn,” he said. At one of Meyerhoffer’s two jobs, he said, his employer has expressed transphobic sentiments to the extent that Meyerhoffer goes by his deadname and uses she/her pronouns at work. Employee protections based on gender exist as part of Title VII, which means Meyerhoffer could potentially file a suit against his employer—but lawsuits can be expensive, time-consuming, and ultimately might not help to combat the day-to-day bigotry that Meyerhoffer (and all trans people) face in the U.S.</p>

<p>In addition, the Equality Act would be passed into law as an addendum to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, so that it would offer the same kind of protections offered by that act—but that act, too, has not been able to prevent insidious forms of voter suppression and strict voter photo ID laws that have increased over the last two decades. While the Equality Act would make the bold step of including gender as a federally protected class, there is a fair chance that it would not be able to offer much in the way of aid to trans people at risk of voter suppression.</p>

<p>It is hard to say, though, what a world without voter suppression and disenfranchisement—voting, economic, and social—would look like. Meyerhoffer isn’t sure. Wolff thinks it should involve eliminating the courthouse aspect from the name and gender marker change process to simplify the process, and to offer trans people more privacy throughout their social transition. Professor Potter thinks that finally passing the Equal Rights Amendment—aimed at equalizing different genders in society—would solidify trans rights within the Constitution. Rowe thinks that a good starting point would be to do away with the often-required doctor’s approval for a gender marker change.</p>

<p>What does seem to be a common thread is that things cannot stay the way that they are now.</p>

<p>For Wolff, this has meant moving from Lafayette to Orlando, Florida. Among other things, he’s found it a much easier place to vote: in 2020, Wolff voted early and in person without a hitch—although he did have to wait in line for nearly three and a half hours in the pouring rain. 
Despite the wait and the downpour, Wolff says he felt comfortable voting in Orlando. “People were decent to each other,” he said. “I didn’t have to worry too much about anyone clocking me, or other issues with voter access.”</p>

<p>Wolff did say, though, that he still doesn’t regret voting in Lafayette, even with the difficulties he experienced at the polls.
“[It] wasn’t ideal, but was worth it to me,” Wolff said. “I would much rather vote than be disenfranchised over this.”</p>
