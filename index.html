<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
	<img src="ben-profile-pic.jpg" id="image1">
	<p>My name is Ben Guess, and I’m a senior at The New School. I have a passion for accurate, detailed, relevant reporting, and have spent the last four years learning how to code in HTML and CSS, working with Adobe Illustrator and Premiere, and learning the ins and outs of data visualization. I believe that the futures of technology and journalism are intertwined, and that newer ways of using that technology—podcasting to an enormous audience on platforms like Spotify, visualizing data in code, using graphics to bolster and illustrate a story of any form—are going to be at the forefront of journalism, going forward. I believe in using diverse types of media to tell diverse types of stories–and that sometimes, too, new forms of media can bring to light unexplored aspects of the stories themselves.

<h2>GRAPHIC DESIGN EXAMPLES</h2>

<p>This is a piece of data visualization that is very close to me. I wanted to see which states in the US were the best for trans individuals to live in, and was forced to lower the bar to which states were "safe"—in this case, what states had hate crime laws on their books—specifically ones mentioning gender in any capacity—and outlawed housing and employment discrimination based on gender. In 2019, at least, only 17 states out of 50 passed this test.</p>
